    post:
      summary: Create one or more consent purposes
      description: |
        Creates one or more consent purposes in a single request. Supports batch creation by accepting 
        an array of purpose definitions.
        
        Each purpose must have a unique name within the organization. The description field is optional 
        and can be used to provide additional context about the purpose.
        
        **Transactional Behavior:**
        Batch creation is atomic - either all purposes in the request are created successfully, or none 
        are created. If any validation fails (e.g., duplicate name, invalid type, missing required field), 
        the entire batch is rolled back and no purposes are persisted to the database. This ensures data 
        consistency and prevents partial batch insertions.
        
        **Validation Rules:**
        - Name is required and must not exceed 255 characters
        - Name must be unique within the organization (checked against existing purposes and within the batch)
        - Type is required and must be one of: `string`, `json-schema`
        - Value is required and can be a string, JSON object, or JSON array
        - Description is optional but must not exceed 1024 characters if provided
        - At least one purpose must be provided in the request array
        - Duplicate names within the same batch are not allowed
        
        **Uniqueness Constraint:**
        If a purpose with the same name already exists for the organization (or appears multiple times 
        in the batch), the entire request will be rejected with a 400 Bad Request error and no purposes 
        will be created.

      summary: Validate consent purpose names
      description: |
        Validates a list of consent purpose names and returns only the valid ones that exist in the database.
        
        This endpoint is useful for:
        - Validating purpose names before creating consents
        - Filtering out invalid purposes from a list
        - Checking which purposes are available in the organization
        
        **Behavior:**
        - Accepts an array of purpose names
        - Returns an array of names that exist in the organization
        - If none of the provided names are valid, returns 400 Bad Request
        - Names are case-sensitive and must match exactly
        - Empty request array returns 400 Bad Request
        
        **Response:**
        - **200 OK**: Returns array of valid purpose names (subset of input)
        - **400 Bad Request**: When request is empty or no valid purposes found
